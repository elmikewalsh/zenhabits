Zenhabits WP Theme

This theme is an adaptation of the original Zenhabits theme, which the site owner (<a href="http://leobabauta.com/" target="_blank">Leo Babauta</a>) offers as an uncopyrighted free download. He also provides a <a href="http://zenhabits.net/install/" target="_blank">set of instructions</a> for installing the theme.

This version of the Zenhabits WordPress Theme eliminates most of these installation steps, or integrates them into WordPress. (for example, instead of hand-editing the menu links, you can now create the menus directly within the WordPress Custom Menus section)
