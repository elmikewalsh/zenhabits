# zenhabits
Initial Upload
This theme is an adaptation of the original Zenhabits theme, which the site owner (Leo Babauta) offers as an uncopyrighted free download. He also provides a set of instructions for installing the theme.

This version of the Zenhabits WordPress Theme eliminates most of these installation steps, or integrates them into WordPress. (for example, instead of hand-editing the menu links, you can now create the menus directly within the WordPress Custom Menus section)
